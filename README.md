# ParkSense: AI for Park Safety and Maintenance
Building AI Course – AI Project Idea

## Summary

ParkSense predicts safety hazards and maintenance needs in public parks using sensor and visitor data, proactively alerting staff to improve safety and park upkeep.

## Background

The project addresses these problems:  
* Fallen trees, broken playground equipment, or wet surfaces can cause accidents.  
* Park maintenance teams often rely on manual inspections, which can be slow.  
* Safety incidents and maintenance delays affect public satisfaction.  

**Personal motivation:** Ensuring that local parks are safe and enjoyable for everyone.  
**Importance:** AI can help communities maintain public spaces efficiently and reduce accidents.

## How it is used

1. **Sensors** (motion, weather, camera feeds) collect data on park conditions.  
2. **Visitors** can submit reports via a mobile app about hazards or broken equipment.  
3. **AI** predicts risk areas and schedules maintenance proactively.  
4. **Park staff** receive alerts and can act before problems escalate.  

**Target users:** Municipal park authorities, maintenance teams, and park visitors.  

## Data sources and AI methods

* **Sensor data:** moisture, temperature, motion detectors  
* **Visitor data:** anonymized foot traffic patterns  
* **Optional image data:** public cameras or drones (ethical guidelines applied)  

**AI methods:**  
* Supervised learning for hazard prediction  
* Classification models to detect unsafe conditions  
* Anomaly detection to spot unusual patterns  
* Optional: computer vision for image-based hazard detection

## Sample Code

Here is a small illustrative example showing how AI could predict hazards using sensor data:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import numpy as np

# ----------------------------
# Sample sensor data: [moisture, temperature, motion]
# ----------------------------
X = np.array([
    [0.3, 22, 5],
    [0.8, 18, 12],
    [0.1, 25, 2],
    [0.5, 20, 8]
])

# Labels: 0 = safe, 1 = hazard
y = np.array([0, 1, 0, 1])

# ----------------------------
# Train a simple classifier
# ----------------------------
clf = RandomForestClassifier()
clf.fit(X, y)

# ----------------------------
# Predict hazard for new sensor reading
# ----------------------------
new_data = np.array([[0.6, 19, 10]])
prediction = clf.predict(new_data)
print("Hazard risk:", "Yes" if prediction[0] == 1 else "No")

# ----------------------------
# Optional alert system
# In a real system, this could trigger an email, push notification, or dashboard alert
# ----------------------------
if prediction[0] == 1:
    print("Alert: Hazard detected! Notify park staff immediately.")

# ----------------------------
# Note: In a real implementation, you would:
# 1. Collect larger datasets from all park sensors
# 2. Preprocess and normalize sensor values
# 3. Evaluate model accuracy with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall
# 4. Integrate with a real-time alert system for park staff
# ----------------------------
```

## Challenges

* Cannot prevent accidents completely; only provides alerts.  
* Sensor coverage may be incomplete, causing missed hazards.  
* Ethical considerations: anonymization of visitor data, privacy for any camera use.  
* Weather conditions or sensor failures may reduce accuracy.

## What next:

* Integration with mobile apps to notify visitors of hazards in real-time.  
* Expansion to multiple parks or city-wide implementation.  
* Use of predictive analytics to schedule proactive maintenance.  
* Collaboration with city planners and IoT engineers for better data collection.
